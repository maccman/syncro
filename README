* Server and Client should look the same?
* Look at GIT's replication
* Use GUID's instead of incrementing IDs?

High level overview of synchronisation:
  If client haven't synced yet:
    * Client asks remote for all scribes
  Otherwise
    * Client asks remote for scribes since last synced
    
  So, each client needs to record its synchronisation state with the other client. I.e. the last message received.




Initially forget authentication.
